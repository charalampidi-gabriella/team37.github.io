            <p>Short project description:
                Our project sets out to create an intuitive robotic assistant capable of autonomous navigation, object
                identification, and the acquisition of accessible information across diverse environments. Built using
                ROS Melodic and the Hiwonder Jetauto Pro robot, our primary goal revolves around the creation of a
                user-friendly system tailored to the specific needs of individuals grappling with mobility or visual
                challenges. The core objectives include seamless execution of scanning, mapping, and precise object
                identification, all converging to deliver a product that helps aid an individual's independence and
                overall inclusivity.
                Our user base spans individuals with varying levels of digital literacy, ensuring that the technology we
                develop transcends barriers and is accessible to a broad and diverse audience. The programming landscape
                involves the languages Python and C++, orchestrated by the ROS Melodic operating system. To enhance our
                object identification capabilities, we incorporate the COCO dataset with YOLO. The hardware backbone of
                our project lies in the Hiwonder Jetauto Pro, a sophisticated robot equipped with LiDAR systems and 3D
                cameras, providing a strong unit of tools for environment perception and object detection.
                Practically, our robotic assistant integrates a network of sensors for environment perception, precise
                actuators for controlled movement, and robust processing units to handle intricate computational tasks.
                However, our project extends beyond regular functionality; it encompasses dependability properties such
                as reliability, security, and safety.
                Given the potentially sensitive and secure environments that the robotic assistant may navigate and map,
                we prioritize a testing regimen, security measures, and safety protocols. These measures collectively
                contribute to the creation of a reliable and trustworthy system, instilling confidence in users and
                stakeholders alike.
                In essence, our project is not just about crafting a new piece of technology; it is about delivering a
                valuable solution that caters to user needs while aligning with broader societal goals of inclusivity
                and accessibility. Through the fusion of cutting-edge technology and a user-centric approach, we strive
                to carve a path towards a future where autonomous robotic assistants seamlessly enhance lives and break
                down barriers for individuals facing unique challenges.
